# AdvantageScope Installation
There are a couple options for how to install AdvantageScope.
1. The easiest way to install is from the [releases](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope/releases/tag/v4.1.6)
on the official AdvantageScope GitHub. However, these builds won't 
include FTC game field images until kickoff. They will work completely 
fine otherwise.

2. If you want FTC specific features, builds with those are available 
[here](https://github.com/PsiLynx/AdvantageScope/releases/tag/v4.1.6a).
These builds don't have mac specific releases, due to code signing issues,
however, you may be able to get one of the Linux builds to work.

**By kickoff, the official AdvantageScope builds will have all the features
that method 2 has.**
